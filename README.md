# Bevel-Helical Gearbox – 3D Visualization Project

This interactive 3D application, built using **Verge3D**, demonstrates the inner workings of a **bevel-helical gearbox**. It features **exploded views**, **clickable part highlighting**, and a **button-based interface** to explore mechanical components intuitively.

---

## Project Objectives

- Visually explain how a bevel-helical gearbox works.
- Provide a hands-on tool for learning gear arrangements and torque transfer.
- Allow users to explore each component.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Verge3D** for real-time 3D rendering and interactivity.
- **Blender** for precise mechanical modeling.
- **JavaScript & HTML** for UI elements and logic.
- **Snipping Tool** for documentation screenshots.

---

## Features

- **Part Highlighting**: Buttons to isolate and focus on each component.
- **Exploded View Mode**: A toggle button to separate all parts for internal inspection.
